            Enjoy!</li>

    <h2> Recipe Notes </h2>
    <p>People swear by <b>Velveeta </b> in this recipe, do not use a substitute.</p>
    <p>While pre-packaged shredded cheese works fine, <b>grating your own</b> is the better option. It just melts
        better.</p>
    <p>Its going to be oily on top after baking, thats how it is with real cheeses and butter. <b>If you think its
            excessive, blot some up with a paper towel while it rests.</b> </p>
    <p> <b>Reheats are great </b>, just pop in the microwave.</p>
